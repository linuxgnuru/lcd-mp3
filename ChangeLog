 == 2.08 (13-09-2015) ==
    - Another huge update; added a rotary encoder for volume control.
    - Rotary encoder uses 3 pins, using RxD, TxD, and SDA.  Now the only pin left unused is SCL from I2C.
    - Now requires libasound to compile.
    - The rotary encoder and volume control was borrowed from the MPD player found here:
