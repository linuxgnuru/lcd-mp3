LCD MP3 player for Raspberry Pi

NOTE: In order to compile, you will need to install the following packages: libao libao-common libao-dev libmpg123 libmpg123-dev mpg321

You'll also need wiringPi which can be found here: http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

This is all from memory, so if I've missed anything, (i.e. it won't compile for you) please let me know so I can update this list.
